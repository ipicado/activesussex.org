When I add an Event onto News & Events, the right hand column of News items on the homepage slips down to the bottom of the Events feed (LHS). The story that I am trying to publish is called 'Ski Sunday comes to Brighton' - I thought that the cause might have been the picture, but have tried publishing without the picture and the same thing happens.

Thanks,

Jo
